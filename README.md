### What I learned

This was the first challenge that I used Javascript. It was an enlightening experience. 

In this challenge I looked at the DOM using my browser's Inspector tyring to figure what elements I could use to solve the problem I had. While I was doing this, I had my lightbulb moment. I finally didn't just know the information but understood it. 

I'm execited to start the next project using Javascript.
